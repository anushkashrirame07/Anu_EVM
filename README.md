# Solidity Project 

#  EVM Course
	This course was organized some basic concepts about Web3 and Blockchain .
	I learnt all concepts given in different modules through this course which i didn't know  earlier .
        I get a project/Challenge at last.


## Project
I have a Project to create contract. In that I created a contract name as MyToken where token name as "deposit" and token abbreviation as "diminish" along with its total supply. If I want to mint some amount of noise tokens then it will be added to the total supply of it. Also if I burns those tokens, it will get subtracted from the total supply. (Which I set to be zero at start)

### Processing The Code 

* I used Online Remix IDE compiler for writing the solidity code Program with a version.
* I created a file which is in the repository named as anu.sol  that same code on GitHub.

### Setting The Program 

* If you are using Remix IDE then you simply compile the code from the  menu. (As a advisory purpose)
* After compiling the code , you have to deploy the Contract from the bar/menu.
* And after deploying the code , you have to enter certain inputs.
